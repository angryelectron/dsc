This is a quick and dirty Netbeans Project that will take an XML-exported RRD database
and convert it to CSV.

To build, run "ant jar".  To run, first export the rrd database into a file
called "dsctemp.xml".  Then change to the "dist" directory and run "java -jar
rrdsolar.jar".  The output will be "dsctemp.csv".
