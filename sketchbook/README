This is the firmware (Arduino sketch) for the DSC controller. Please see
http://angryelectron.com/projects/dsc for more information.

Set your Arduino IDE Sketchbook directory to this one to automatically include
the dependent libraries (DallasTemperature and OneWire), if you don't have them
installed elsewhere.
